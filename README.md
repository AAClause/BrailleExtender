BrailleExtender is an [NVDA](http://nvda-project.org/) add-on that provides various features at braille level. Currently, the following features are implemented:

* Reload two favorite braille display with shortcuts.
* Automatic review cursor tethering for selected apps.
* Auto scroll.
* Switch between several input/output braille tables.
* Define custom rules to mark text with special fields option with braille dots 7 and 8.
* Use two output braille tables simultaneously.
* Display tab signs as spaces.
* Reverse forward scroll and back scroll buttons.
* Say the current line during text scrolling.
* Etc..

For some braille displays, it extends the braille display commands to provide:

* Access to function keys, multimedia keys, quick navigation.
* Emulate modifier keys, and thus any keyboard shortcut.
* Offer several keyboard configurations concerning the possibility to input dots 7 and 8, enter and backspace.
* Open applications/URLs/files quickly.
* Actions and quick navigation through a rotor.

Once the add-on is installed, read the documentation and go through the settings using the BrailleExtender menu (located at the root of NVDA menu). The documentation is mainly generated automatically because it depends on the braille display in use.
