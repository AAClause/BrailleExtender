BrailleExtender is an [NVDA](http://nvda-project.org/) add-on that provides various features at braille level. Currently, the following features are implemented:

* Reload two favorite braille display with shortcuts.
* Automatic review cursor tethering in terminal role like in PuTTY, Powershell, bash, cmd.
* Auto scroll.
* Switch between several input/output braille tables.
* Mark the text with special attributes through dot 7, dot 8 or both.
* Use two output braille tables simultaneously.
* Display tab signs as spaces.
* Reverse forward scroll and back scroll buttons.
* Say the current line during text scrolling either in review mode, or in focus mode or both.
* Translate text easily in Unicode braille and vice versa. E.g.: z <--> ⠵.
* Convert cell description to Unicode braille and vice versa. E.g.: 123 <--> ⠇.
* Lock braille keyboard.
* Launch an application/URL with gesture.
* Braille dictionaries.
* And much more!

For some braille displays, it extends the braille display commands to provide:

* offer complete gesture maps including function keys, multimedia keys, quick navigation, etc.;
* emulate modifier keys, and thus any keyboard shortcut;
* offer several keyboard configurations concerning the possibility to input dots 7 and 8, enter and backspace;
* actions and quick navigation through a rotor.

Once the add-on is installed, read the documentation and go through the settings using the BrailleExtender submenu (located in the NVDA menu).
