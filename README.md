BrailleExtender
===============

Description
-----------
BrailleExtender is a [NVDA](http://nvda-project.org/) add-on that provides various features at braille level. Currently, the following features are implemented:

* reload two favorite braille display with shortcuts;
* automatically switch in review mode in apps;
* auto scroll;
* switch between several input/output braille tables;
* define custom rules to mark text with special fields option with braille dots 7 and 8;
* use two output braille tables simultaneously;
* display tab signs as spaces;
* reverse forward scroll and back scroll buttons;
* say the current line during text scrolling, in review mode.

Besides, for some braille displays, it extends the mapping:

* access to function keys, multimedia keys, quick navigation;
* emulate modifier keys, and thus any keyboard shortcut;
* offer several keyboard configurations concerning the possibility to input dots 7 and 8, enter and backspace;
* launch applications quickly;
* actions and quick navigation through a rotor.

Once the add-on is installed, I suggest you read the documentation and go through the settings using the BrailleExtender menu (located at the root of NVDA menu).
