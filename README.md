BrailleExtender is an [NVDA](http://nvda-project.org/) add-on that provides various features at braille level. Currently, the following features are implemented:

* reload two favorite braille display with shortcuts;
* automatic review cursor tethering in terminal role like in PuTTY, Powershell, bash, cmd;
* auto scroll;
* switch between several input/output braille tables;
* mark the text with special attributes through dot 7, dot 8 or both;
* use two output braille tables simultaneously;
* display tab signs as spaces;
* reverse forward scroll and back scroll buttons;
* say the current line during text scrolling either in review mode, or in focus mode or both;
* translate text easily in Unicode braille and vice versa;
* convert quickly cell description to Unicode braille and vice versa. E.g.: 123 <--> ⠇;
* lock braille keyboard;
* and much more!

For some braille displays, it extends the braille display commands to provide:

* offer complete gesture maps including function keys, multimedia keys, quick navigation, etc.;
* emulate modifier keys, and thus any keyboard shortcut;
* offer several keyboard configurations concerning the possibility to input dots 7 and 8, enter and backspace;
* launch an application quickly;
* actions and quick navigation through a rotor.

Once the add-on is installed, read the documentation and go through the settings using the BrailleExtender submenu (located in preferences menu) or under NVDA Menu -> Preferences -> Settings -> *Braille Extender*. The documentation is mainly generated automatically because it depends on the braille display in use.
