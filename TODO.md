# To do list
Here are some ideas of features for BrailleExtender that might be implemented. Possibly unsorted, immature and useless. Everyone can enrich it:

- Add his own input/output braille tables
- Braille tables switcher: implement group of input/output tables
- Braille multiple through language detection (in tagged documents)
- Quick launches -> quick actions: system of macros (write text, make a succession of shortcuts...)
- System of gestures in several step / custom virtual  modifiers. E.g.: b1+b0 then b1 -> go to desktop
- Text attributes with tags.
- Text attributes with dot(s) 7 or/and 8 blinking
- "Virtual settings" mode (like "auto test" mode)
- Clic with routings cursors in review mode
- Left margin
- Read from right to left
- One Hand Mode
- Try to report center, left and right alignments
- Imitate formatting mode from JAWS
- Import/export settings (particularly for role labels)
- Mark selected elements with dots 7 and 8 (e.g. in explorer)
- Skip cells with non-functioning dots
- Rotor: customization via settings and make it smarter (e.g. don't show links, headingsâ€¦ in non-virtual documents)
- Code cleaning
